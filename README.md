# Credit-card-Defaulters
In this project Use machine learning to predict the probability of credit default based on credit
card owner’s characteristics and payment history. The dataset includes 25 variables with
features and Label columns. This data was extracted from Kaggle to classify weather customer
is delault or not.


I have done this project in the modular code fashion.I have done below steps


1.Validating Client data &Transimission
2.Clustering the data for better performance
3.Training individual models and Prediction


Algorithms : Kmeans clustering, Naïve Bayes ,XG boost
